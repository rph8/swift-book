# Introduction

After a few years of Swift development, I have come across a few tips and tricks that I want to share with the world, mostly because they were often annoying and time-consuming to figure out on my end. And because it is great to have them for my own reference.

I also run a blog at sylvilagus.com/blog, where I write about even more things. I will move the topics here that I consider most important for reference during a longer time period, whereas the blog also contains some more temporary recipes and observations.
