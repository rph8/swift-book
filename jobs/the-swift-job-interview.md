# The Swift Job Interview

Generally these topics tend to come up in tech interviews often:

* Algorithms and data structures
* iOS and non-iOS app architecture patterns
* Memory Management
* REST APIs, URL requests
* Swift UI
* Core Data / SwiftData / Realm
* Concurrency / async / Combine / Actors
* Testing: Unit tests, integration, snapshots
* Continuous integration / deployment

Depending on the specific job, there may be more questions, often centering around specific APIs that are used in the app you are supposed to build / extend.&#x20;

### Algorithms and Data Structures

This is for some roles still a core component in many interviews, independent of the programming language. Tests range from a number of quiz-like questions to small implementation tasks.

#### Typical Questions

* What is the difference between an Array and an NSArray?
* What is ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)?
* Are Strings / Arrays pass by reference or pass by value in Swift?

#### Typical Coding Tasks

* Fizzbuzz
* Implement quicksort
* Transform a String into a tree-like datastructure



### iOS and non-iOS app architecture patterns

This is mostly about how you can distribute the responsibilities between Views, Models and all sorts of glue logic in between, so essentially between the visible part of the UI, the business logic, storage, interaction with webservices etc.

#### Typical Questions

* What are MVC, MVP and MVVM and how do they differ from each other?
* What is VIPER?
* What is Command–query separation?

#### Typical Coding / Drawing Tasks

* Draw up an architecture diagram of an app that displays images for an Instagram-like app.
* Draft the most important classes to fetch, show and cache images.
