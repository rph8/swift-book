# The Swift Job Interview

Generally these topics tend to come up in tech interviews often:

* Algorithms and data structures
* iOS and non-iOS app architecture patterns
* REST APIs, URL requests
* Swift UI
* Core Data / SwiftData / Realm
* Concurrency / async / Combine
* Testing: Unit tests, integration, snapshots
* Continuous integration / deployment



Depending on the specific job, there may be more questions, often centering around specific APIs that are used in the app you are supposed to build / extend.&#x20;
