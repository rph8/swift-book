# swift-docc

swift-docc is "the new kid on the block" and might be the way to go for documenting any Swift code.

### What swift-docc can not do

Before you jump into it too quickly, a small warning though on what swift-docc can not achieve (at the moment):

* Your own app code: swift-docc will only include frameworks, not your own app's code (as of Jan 2022).
* Other programming languages: Objective-C and other languages are not supported at the moment.
