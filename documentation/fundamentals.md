# Fundamentals



### Why do we even write documentation?

#### Be nice to your fellow developer

Documentation is super important, but often done wrong. How many times have you come across an existing commercial software project that you have to take over and your first thought was: "Ough, it would be faster to just rewrite everything from scratch than to understand and update this code."&#x20;

In those cases where you have access to the original developers, this is typically not such a big problem. Because they are the "documentation". If they will be still be around for a while, then you are lucky, you can just ask them for an intro or Q\&A round whenever you need something.

But whenever the original devs are not so available anymore, you tend to be in trouble. Actually, in my experience it is rarely the case that the devs are still available for a session. Often they have left the company, worked for some agency which no longer has is working on this gig, or they are still in your company but are working on a new project now and get very little time from their manager to answer your questions.

#### Be nice to yourself

But that is not the whole story. Imagine working on some project as a single developer. Two years later, you are still there, maybe you are the lead dev now. But now you have five developers in your team. For the first time in two years, you have to touch some old code, because you need to migrate an API to a new one since the old one is being discontinued. At first you think this should be an easy task, but open starting your first coding task, you realize that you do not quite know anymore how all this works and what you (yes you!) thought when building all this.
