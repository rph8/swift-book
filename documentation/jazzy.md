# Jazzy

Jazzy is a great documentation tool. It is maintained by Realm.

You might have seen that swift-docc exists as well. The main reason for using Jazzy at the moment is that swift-docc does not support generating documentation of your own code. swift-docc is purely focused on frameworks, so you could only generate documentation of your own frameworks, but not the main app's code.
